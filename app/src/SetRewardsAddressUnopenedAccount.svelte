            In Banano, accounts (addresses) must receive a transaction before they are "opened" and their representative
            can be changed.

            After you open the account, JungleTV will ask you to temporarily change its representative to a random
            address it will specify, in order to prove that you own this account.

            The account you specified is still unopened. You must receive some Banano in the account in order to open it

            If this is your first time using Banano and you do not have any to send to your new account, you can get a
